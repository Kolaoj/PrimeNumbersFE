# PrimeNumbersFE

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.0.

## Improvements

Given more time I would have implemented some end to end/ integration testing to ensure that when the button is clicked the endpoint is called and the correct values are returned.

I would have also created a test to ensure that when a user sends a value outside of 1-100 a BadRequest is sent back, and the error is handled.

Finally, I perhaps would have used more styling around the button and placed the PrimeNumbers textbox, results and button in the centre of the page.
